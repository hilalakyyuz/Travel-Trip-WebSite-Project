I developed this project using the ASP.NET MVC 5 framework, and it includes four different themes: Easy Trip Theme, Blog Detail Theme, Login Theme, and Admin Panel Theme. These themes aim to provide a platform that serves as a guide for those planning to travel to Morocco.

The project manages database operations using the Code First approach, allowing users to dynamically manage the site content.

Technologies and Libraries Used: 
▪ ASP.NET MVC 5 Framework
▪ Entity Framework Code First Approach
▪ MVC Architecture
▪ LINQ Queries
▪ CRUD Operations
▪ Authentication and Authorization
